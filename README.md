# Vite + React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Biome + Bun + Vitest

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with a few modern tools. This also uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

The Biome rules included here are the directly migrated rules from prettier and eslint from the original repo, while deduplicating and keeping all the recommended biome rules.
